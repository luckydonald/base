description: "Work on exactly ONE open todo of a project, the next unchecked `- [ ]` item of its todo file (intel, plan, implement, commit, tick, complete on CalDAV, sync, rebase), then stop so the user can /clear and run it again for the next one. Todos are synced from CalDAV into the todo file (calendar 7 by default). Use whenever the user asks to do the next todo, work on the todos / `ai/todos.md` / the TODO list of a project, or says 'go through the todos'."

# Todo loop (one todo per run)

Does the **next open todo** of one project, then stops so the user can `/clear` and run it again. Never start a second todo in the same run. Todos live on CalDAV (see the `sync-todo-mcp` skill) and are mirrored into the project's todo file by `scripts/sync_todos.py`.

## Setup

1. Sync first: run `uv run scripts/°base/ai/todos/sync_todos.py` from the repo root, without `--purge-*`, so the todo files hold the current CalDAV state. It commits its own `[TODOs] synced todos …` commits.
2. Work out the project (tag or name, from the user's message or a named todo file). If none is named, or the current project has no open todo, choose automatically: the current project first, then its subprojects and the other projects of `ai/settings/sync_todos.json` that have a `path` in the gitignored `ai/settings/sync_todos.local.json` (a `null` path is out of scope, never touch it), taking the first one that has an open `- [ ]` item; never stop to ask which project. Then work out its todo file, calendar id (default `7`), Bugsink ids and commit scope prefix. All come from the repo `CLAUDE.md` ("Todo-list identifiers", "Issue-tracker identifiers") and the project's own `CLAUDE.md`.
3. Load `/commit-with-lplp-style` and `/code-style`.
4. Read the todo file and take the first open `- [ ]` item, unless another is clearly more urgent (crash, blocker). A subtask comes before its parent; skip items that say so. Tell the user which todo (uid, summary) you take, and why if it is not the first.

## The todo

1. **Intel** (normal mode): reproduce and understand using the MCPs and throwaway scripts in the scratchpad. No project edits yet. If the todo holds several bugs, make them subtasks first (`create_todo` with `parent_uid` and the project tag) and work on the first only.
2. **Plan**: enter plan mode, write the plan (findings, files, tests, new i18n keys) into the project's plan file, wait for the user's accept. Corrections are decisions.
3. **Implement**: code plus tests, as plain new commits (no rebase yet). Run the project's full test suite and lint/build; on red, fix, commit, rerun until green. Update the project's `CLAUDE.md` if behaviour worth knowing changed.
4. **Close**: tick the checkbox, `complete_todo(calendar_id, uid)`, then `uv run scripts/°base/ai/todos/sync_todos.py --project <project>` from the repo root, without `--purge-*`. Re-read the todo file afterwards, since the sync may have rewritten it.
5. **Rebase**: tag the prior HEAD with `scripts/tag_backup.py`, then interactively rebase the `ai:` auto-commits and fix commits into one work commit (message from `ai/git/pending-commit.md`). Also squash a directly preceding plan commit, and the `[TODOs] synced todos …` commit written after completing the todo (whatever todos it changed) into the work commit. The sync of step 1 folds the same way into the previous completed task's commit if that one is not pushed yet (`/commit-with-lplp-style`: a todo sync always squashes into the last completed unpushed task). Verify `git diff <bak-tag> HEAD` is empty.
6. **Stop**: report in a few lines (todo done, commit hash, tests run, what needs a deploy to verify, leftovers), name the next open todo, and end the turn.

## Rules

- One commit per todo; never commit unrelated files.
- Follow the project's `CLAUDE.md` (e.g. sync_todo: new UI strings in all six `frontend/src/i18n/locales/*.json`, bot strings in `i18n/langs/*.py`).
- Never delete or clean up data (duplicate todos, files), reset, or push unasked; report it instead.

## No open todo left

Only when no project (including subprojects) has an open todo: check Bugsink for new unresolved issues (see `bugsink-triage`; skip if the project has none), `create_todo` for each, and stop. Otherwise report that everything is done.
